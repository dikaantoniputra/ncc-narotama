            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
            account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one 
            rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
            but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves 
            or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
            occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some 
            great pleasure. 
            <br><br>
            To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical 
            exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to 
            find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying 
            consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? But I 
            must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising
